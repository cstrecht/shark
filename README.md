The Shark project (aka SharkPool) is a social media platform inspired by other existing social media platforms, allowing users to perform tasks such as posting, editing, or deleting content. SharkPool seamlessly integrates with the [DummyAPI](https://dummyapi.io/). It also features a user-friendly onboarding process, facilitating the creation of new accounts or logging into existing ones.
